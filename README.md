### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Analyzing the theater campaigns, as we can see in the graphic, May and June are the months in which there was more launched campaigns, also May was the most successful month, with a 67% of successful campaigns (111 of 166), followed by June with a 65% of success.
In the other hand we can see that December is a month in which we donâ€™t have an important number of launched campaigns, we just have 75 campaigns, of which 49%, the lowest rate, were successful campaigns.

The failed and canceled campaigns are having a standard performance throughout all the months, the failed campaigns moves around 30 and 50 campaigns per month. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?



- What are some limitations of this dataset?



- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
